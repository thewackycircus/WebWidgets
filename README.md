# 50Projects
50 projects to teach me how to use CSS and JavaScript to create interesting and interactive webpages that are both functional and pretty.

All of these projects are built off of the projects taught in this course:

I have done my best to add or alter each one in order to cement my own learning as well as to prove i undertsood the concepts taught.
