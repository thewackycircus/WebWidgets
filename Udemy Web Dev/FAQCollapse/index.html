                <p class="faq-text">
                    A web developer is a programmer who makes websites, and apps
                    for the World Wide Web. A web developer builds a website
                    from the bottom up, developing everything from layout to
                    functions and features on the page. TL;DR: a web developer
                    makes what you’re looking at right now. A good web developer
                    can make almost anything happen on a website, and can build
                    custom code to accommodate the needs of their client. Web
                    developers have an intricate understanding of various
                    programming languages and how they’re used. A web developer
                    might work at one organization as a permanent full-time
                    employee, or work as an independent consultant. A web
                    developer salary depends on what kind of work you’re
                    involved in, your location, experience and level of
                    seniority.

                    Are a web developer and a web designer the same thing?
                </h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    Not exactly. Here’s how it breaks down: A web developer is
                    more concerned with functionality and features of a website,
                    and versed in the programming languages required to create
                    them. Web developers will still need to understand the
                    aesthetics and art direction of the site as they implement
                    features. A web designer will create the logos, graphics,
                    and layout that determine the look and feel of a website.
                    Web designers will use software like Adobe Photoshop and
                    Illustrator to create these materials. A web designer with a
                    knowledge of code can help him/her better communicate with
                    the web developer. A developer with skills in both
                    development and design is extremely valuable, and could make
                    for a great PM (project manager) on any web project.

                    Web development isn’t just building what the user sees.
                    There’s a lot underneath the hood of a modern website, and a
                    good web developer can traverse across the entire terrain.

                <p class="faq-text">
                    Client-side scripting refers to the creation of a website’s
                    layout, look and feel, using languages like HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. It also refers to the creation of web apps that
                    execute themselves inside a user’s web browser.

                <h3 class="faq-title">Server-side scripting:</h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    Server-side scripting is used by web developers to create
                    the back-end of a website. It involves constructing the
                    framework allowing the database of the website to
                    communicate with the user’s web browser. This is done by
                    embedding scripts into your site, where images or
                    information will be displayed upon a particular action taken
                    by the user.
